            Tell me somethin', girl <br>
            Are you happy in this modern world? <br>
            Or do you need more? <br>
            Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for? <br>
            I'm fallin' <br>
            In all the good times <br>
            I find myself longin' for change <br>
            And in the bad times, <br>
            I fear myself Tell me something, boy <br>
            Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? <br>
            Or do you need more? <br>
            Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore? <br>
            I'm falling <br>
            In all the good times <br>
            I find myself longing for change <br>
            And in the bad times, <br>
            I fear myself <br>
            I'm off the deep end, watch as <br>
            I dive in I'll never meet the ground <br>
            Crash through the surface, <br>
            where they can't hurt us <br>
            We're far from the shallow now.<br>
            Oh, ha-ah-ah Ah <br>
